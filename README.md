Ikea SOMIG shortcut button conversion to custom board

For my smarthome I've converted an Ikea SOMRIG shortcut button into a custom board that fits inside my Gira 55 frame and button.
The design allows you to easily remove the remote from the wall to swap out the battery, currently the battery size is AAAA (4xA)

I will add the gerber files and the stl so you are able to order it your self.
